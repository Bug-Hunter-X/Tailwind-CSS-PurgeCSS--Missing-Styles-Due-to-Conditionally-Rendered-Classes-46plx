This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with PurgeCSS or similar tools that remove unused CSS.  If you have a class that's conditionally rendered (e.g., based on JavaScript state) and PurgeCSS doesn't detect its usage, it will remove the associated styles, leading to unexpected visual issues. For example:

```html
<div :class="{ 'hidden': !isVisible }">
  <p>This text might disappear!</p>
</div>
```

```javascript
data() {
  return {
    isVisible: false
  };
}
```

If PurgeCSS runs before the JavaScript sets `isVisible` to `true`, the `hidden` class's styles will be removed, and the text will remain hidden even when it should be visible.
